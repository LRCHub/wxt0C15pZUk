```lrc
[00:01.35] In the city of the dead
[00:03.18] I lay stuck inside my bed
[00:05.11] The house burns down around me
[00:08.99] The language of the lost
[00:10.59] Pouring from their open mouths
[00:12.76] Nobody can hear a thing
[00:16.54] Suddenly I'm breathing in the smoke
[00:19.99] Surrounded by the bodies
[00:23.45] As I'm tugging on my chains
[00:25.32] I'll be swallowed by the flames
[00:27.49] Freedom dripping from the sink
[00:42.49] 
[00:31.75] I don't need forgiveness
[00:34.93] I just wanna talk and for you to listen
[00:38.82] I know I'd only raise the suspicion of my cause
[00:43.65] My burns, they throb to the beat of your heart
[01:06.65] 
[00:48.48] Am I a robot or a doll?
[00:51.14] Am I anything at all?
[00:52.98] Maybe a soul like me
[00:54.25] Doesn't even need to know
[00:56.65] Am I big or am I small?
[00:58.49] Hunching over, standing tall?
[01:00.20] I lost my identity
[01:01.65] Oh so very long ago
[01:03.94] Software update, reinstall
[01:05.72] Scary things I can't recall
[01:07.83] Making the best of it
[01:08.96] Never even knowing why
[01:11.56] On my knees, I try to crawl
[01:13.26] Fire breaking in the walls
[01:15.00] Calling out for somebody
[01:16.56] Knowing I'll get no reply
[01:29.06] 
[01:18.80] As I woke up from the dream
[01:20.89] I had lost all self esteem
[01:22.76] The burning home had cowed me
[01:26.28] I thought that I was safe
[01:28.07] Now I'll never be the same
[01:30.03] Tossed aside for making a scene
[01:33.92] Do I know who I pretend to be?
[01:37.47] Of whom am I a copy?
[01:40.97] Yes, it made me who I am
[01:42.85] But I'll never understand
[01:45.06] Why it had to happen to me
[01:58.06] 
[01:49.22] Temperament or sickness?
[01:52.57] Holler all you want! No one ever listens
[01:56.69] If only I had raised my suspicious of the cause
[02:01.26] Would you have noticed it at all?
[02:17.76] 
[02:04.06] If I'm a robot or a doll?
[02:06.94] Am I anything at all?
[02:08.64] Maybe a thing like me
[02:09.90] Doesn't yet deserve to know
[02:12.48] Am I big or am I small?
[02:14.35] Hunching over, standing tall?
[02:15.99] I lost my identity
[02:17.33] Oh so very long ago
[02:19.59] Ones and zeros
[02:20.52] True or false?
[02:21.56] Reset system to default
[02:23.35] Faking the rest of it
[02:24.76] But I can't remember why
[02:27.13] On my knees, I try to crawl
[02:28.95] Fire-charred collapsing walls
[02:30.83] Crying out for somebody
[02:32.22] There is no one to reply
[02:44.22] 
[03:04.04] Not robot nor a doll
[03:05.90] I'm not anything at all
[03:07.71] I'm just an entity
[03:09.12] Finding out the way to go
[03:11.42] But these fingers and these palms
[03:13.24] Full of love despite the scars
[03:14.89] They show indisputably
[03:16.59] I have so much more to grow
[03:18.68] Oh, I can change I can evolve
[03:20.75] I can get up when I fall
[03:22.51] I'll live contentedly
[03:23.83] I don't need a reason why
[03:26.14] Standing tall and standing strong
[03:28.06] I have found where I belong
[03:29.89] In the arms of somebody
[03:31.19] There is no more need to cry
